            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Why is their marriage reproued which they might lawfully contract? if they did ſynne, as indeed they did, then how is the vow vnlawful? how the brand of <hi>Antichriſtianiſme?</hi> how doth it induce an impoſſible neceſſity?

Euery Prieſt or Biſhop ought at leaſt once to be marryed, for neither doth S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> graunt this law, or S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> deny the other, but both iointly agree, that none heereby is bound to marry, and he that<note place="margin">Tertull. exhort. ad caſtitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. 7.

                  <p>41.

Wherefore to obtrude it for ſuch, is a meere cooſenage of his friend, and deluding of his Reader, or if he, more then his mates, will admit theſe Canons, then let him expound vs the 17. in order, wherin it is decreed that none can be made Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, who hath marryed a widdow, or one who was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced from her husband, or a ſeruing mayd: which if it were practiſed amongſt them in our country, and all ſuch depoſed as are ſo marryed, who ſeeth not that the Engliſh Clergy would be ſoone reduced to a ſmaller number.</p>

But as men in their ſleep do dreame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of great wealth, &amp; when they wake do find nothing, ſo <hi>M.

               <p>6. The wordes he citeth of S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> are theſe: <hi>Many Bishops haue not marryed, and contrarily Monkes haue beene fathers of children, as contrarily you ſee Bishops the fathers of children and Monkes that haue not ſought poſterity.</hi> So out of S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which ſo little ſerueth to our purpoſe, as <hi>M. Hall</hi> might haue been aſhamed to alleadge it: for what will he infer of theſe wordes? that Biſhops &amp; Monks may lawfully marry? S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſayth it not, but only recounteth the fact that ſome marryed of both ſorts, but whether they did well or ill,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8889:76"/> or whether himſelfe did approue or condemne the ſame, there is no word in this ſentence: but if <hi>M. Hall</hi> had not taken his authorityes by retayle of ſome blind note-booke, but had fetched them himſelfe from the originalls, <hi>this witnes without exception that muſt ſerue for a thouſand hiſtories,</hi> had<note place="margin">The true ſenſe and meaning of S.

For ſo far is S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> from allowing Biſhops and Monkes to haue wiues, as in this place he reprehendeth the lewd behauiour of ſome who liued in the one and other ſtate, I meane Epiſcopall dignity, and Monaſticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the occaſion whereof was giuen him by <hi>Dracontius,</hi> who at the perſwaſion as it ſhould ſeeme of the Monkes, would not yield to <hi>S.

S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> anſwereth heere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ſhewing theſe dangers to be no leſſe in Monaſticall, then Epiſcopall profeſſion, and that as well by the ſcandalous examples which had fallen out in both, as eminent vertue which had beene found in either: for thus he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: <hi>Nec dicas, nec dicentibus credas Epiſcopatum eſſe cauſam peccati, aut quod inde naſcantur occaſiones deliu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi &amp;c.</hi> Tell me not, nor belieue them who tell you that Epiſcopality is the cauſe of ſinne, or that from thence proceed the occaſions of <q>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: and a little after: <hi>Ne igitur talia obijciant tui Conſiliarij.</hi> Let nor thoſe who counſaile you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect theſe thinges: for we haue knowne Biſhops faſting, and Monkes feeding; we haue knowne
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8889:77"/> Biſhops not drinking wine, and Monkes drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; we haue knowne Biſhops working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and Monkes working none; many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops not to haue marryed, and Monkes to haue had children; as likewiſe you may find Biſhops to haue beene fathers of children, and Monkes not to haue ſought for marriage; Clergy men to haue tipled, &amp; Monkes to haue beene abſtinent.</q> So he. Shewing both the one &amp; the other ſtate, by their bad members, to be ſubiect to abuſe, &amp; concludeth: <hi>Non enim coroha pro locis, ſed pro factis redditur.</hi> The crowne of glory is not giuen for the place, or profeſſion we liue in, but for the good workes we do in that profeſſion.</p>
               <p>7.

               <p>32. And leaſt <hi>M. Hall</hi> obiect that this pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

               <p>33. Notwithſtanding this his griefe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue, yet did this his Metropolitan put him to<note place="margin">S.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8889:89"/> both graue and ancient relateth, that at the end of the ſeauenth yeare, when on the Wedneſday in the holy week before Eaſter, he had watched all the night in Prayer, and with tears bewailed his offence, he was comforted by an Angell, and aduertiſed that his prayers were heard, his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was accepted, and the ſinne forgiuen, &amp; ſo was deliuered from that priſon, and reſtored againe to his Biſhopricke, liuing al the reſidew of his life, as the Author ſayth, <hi>inſanctitate &amp; iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> in holynes and vertue, alwayes preaching the mercyes of God, which to himſelfe in ſuch abundant meaſure had beene ſhewed.</p>
               <p>34. What thinke you of this <hi>M. Hall?</hi> Was<note place="margin">Sanderus l. 1. de Sciſ. mat. Aug.</note> it free in theſe tymes for Biſhops to vſe their wiues as you pretend?

And truly theſe two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being ſo directly againſt the vſe of wiues, and M. <hi>Hall</hi> being not able to bring one to the contrary, wherein it was allowed as lawfull for any Biſhop or Prieſt after holy Orders taken to haue any, let the Reader iudge which doctrine and practiſe beſt agreeth, or diſagreeth moſt,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8889:90"/> with the former tymes, and purer ages (as our Aduerſaries ſometymes will cal them of the firſt ſix hundred yeares) ours or theirs: for heer you haue nothing brought for them, but that ſome Biſhops had beene marryed men, others made Biſhops in that ſtate, which is not denyed: but that then they might vſe their wiues <hi>M.

And for the catalogue he heere maketh of marryed Biſhops, it hath no more truth, and<note place="margin">Many groſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakings.</note> ſincerity in it, then the reſt: for beſides that he citeth Authors at randome as <hi>Euſeb. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 29. when as there be there but 26. chapters, and for things which are not to be found in him, which I paſſe ouer as petty faults, beſides this I ſay to increaſe the number of his Biſhops, he maketh <hi>S.

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:8889:97"/> to entertaine tyme, and deceaue their Readers? in my iudgment this is impudency in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue degree, and for this alone he deſerueth for euer to be diſcredited; ſeeing he could not but know what we had anſwered to this Synod, &amp; and that himſelf was not able therunto to make any reply, but this his tallent of ſhameles dealing will better appeare in all the other particulers, which I will now in order diſcuſſe.</p>
               <p>52. Firſt then he ſayth that this was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, and ſo he ſtill tearmeth it <hi>the ſixt generall Councell,</hi> but this we haue now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">The Trul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> to be falſe: for it was neither the ſixth, nor yet generall, as not called by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by him who had no authority, no Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon ſent from the Sea Apoſtolike was there, which in no generall Councel law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſembled was euer wanting, none of the reſt of the Patriarches of the Eaſt were preſent, none of the Weſt inuited, and the Canons by ſupreme authority at their firſt appearance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, which things cannot agree to a true generall Councell: and if it were Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (as M. <hi>Hall</hi> ſhall neuer make more of it if he make ſo much) then can it not make lawes to bind the whole Church, but that particuler pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince wherein it was made, and if theſe alſo by higher power be condemned, as in this caſe it happeneth, then doth it not bind that neither, or any place els, but is to be refuſed of all, as was the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> called by S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which allowed the rebaptizing of infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which had beene chriſtened by heretickes, which M. <hi>Hall</hi> might as well haue vrged againſt vs, as this

               <p>55. In the 32. Canon it is commanded that<note place="margin">Canon 32.</note> water be mingled with the wine in the ſacrifice and that in this forme of wordes: <hi>Quoniam ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram</hi>

                  <q>and becauſe in his owne Church where he was Biſhop, he appointed, when the vnbloudy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was offered, water to be mingled with the wine, prouing this doctrine out of the pretious ſoueraigne bloud, &amp; water which iſſued from our Sauiours ſide, &amp; was ſhed for the life of the</q> world, and redemption of ſinners.</p>
               <p>56.

               <p>57.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8889:99"/> tradition, which with M. <hi>Hall</hi> makes no proofe and for al this we haue the authority of another Councell of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſo as this one Canon of this <hi>ſacred</hi> Synod allowes vs as I ſayd three Catholike truths, and hath nothing for Miniſters, but that they are not defenders of water alone without wine in their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with which hereſy no man who knoweth well their natures will euer charge them: for they are ſo far from that errour, as they will taſt as little water as they may, and drinke nothing but of the pure grape without any other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to allay the heat: but let vs ſee ſome few more Canons.</p>

And if Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall men by this Councell haue an expreſſe prohibition to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, then I infer that they are reſtrained: for if this prohibition were not, the decree of their marriage were more ful, more peremptory, more abſolute, as he hath more ful peremptory and abſolute liberty who is free to go where he will, then he who is forbidden many places where els willingly he would go: this needeth no more proofe, then this other: heere it is midnight, <hi>ergo</hi> heere it is not noone day.</p>
               <p>66. The ſecond point defyned is in the 6. Canon, where according to the conſtitutions of the Apoſtles it is determined: <hi>Vt deinceps nulli peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to marry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note>

So there, which particulerly toucheth M. <hi>Hall</hi> if he haue any orders: for I vnderſtand that he was Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter firſt and marryed after, which heere to ſuch as be in holy orders is abſolutely forbidden, and thereupon it followes that ſuch as were made Prieſts, Deacons, or Subdeacons of marryed men after the death of their wiues, were for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8889:102"/> debarred from marrying againe.</p>
               <p>67. The third thing decreed is, that which<note place="margin">Biſhops forbidden to vſe their wiue which they had before their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> before I mentioned out of the 10. and 48. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, in both which Biſhops are forbidden not only to vſe their wiues, but alſo to dwell with them, yea their wiues are commanded to liue in a Monaſtery, which muſt be <hi>procul ab Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi habitatione exſtructum,</hi> built far off from the houſe of the Biſhop, where the ſayd Biſhops are commanded to prouide for them: and that if any do the contrary he be depoſed.</p>
               <p>68. The 4. and laſt thing is, that which <hi>M. Hall</hi> hath painted out in his margent, ſetting it<note place="margin">The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to be made Prieſts, but with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction.</note> downe at full length, and it is only the mayne proofe of his epiſtle, of which he ſo much brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and vaunteth as you haue heard, and ſayth that it is as full and abſolute a decree <hi>as any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church can make,</hi> or els he will be condemned as <hi>faithles:</hi> and to the end he may not complaine that I extenuate or diminiſh the force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by following another tranſlation, as leſſe fauouring him, although in the thing it ſelfe I find no difference in any edition: I will take the Text out of his owne booke, truly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of Greeke into Latin (as he ſayth) by <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> though I need not to take all for truth, which M. <hi>Hall</hi> (whome preſently by his owne teſtimony I ſhall condemne for <hi>faithles</hi>) propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for ſuch. Thus then it runneth.</p>

                  <q>profeſſe for the tyme to come neuer to know their wiues, we following the old Canon of the Apoſtolicall, ſincere, exquiſite, and orderly conſtitution, will haue the lawful coniugal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of holy men (or men in holy Orders) euen from this day heereafter to be valid &amp; firme no wayes diſſoluing their coniunction or copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with their owne wiues: therefore if any one be found worthy &amp;c. he is not to be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to aſcend to this degree, for that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with his lawfull wife, neither let it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him in the tyme of his ordering, or be compelled that he would or ought to abſtayn from the lawful vſe of his owne wife. So he out of the Councell. And this is that rare iewell he hath found in ſcraping the dunghill of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</q> Synod.</p>
               <p>70. All theſe things then being defyned in this Councell, let vs now ſee whether this one decree be ſo full, abſolute, peremptory, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous,<note place="margin">No Biſhop named in the Trul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non cyted by M.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome can make a more full, for the marriage of Eccleſiaſticall perſons: for firſt no Biſhop is heer named, and by other Canons they are by name excluded. Againe heere is no graunt for Prieſts to marry after their ordination, nor yet is that recalled of hauing but one wife, or debarring ſuch as haue marryed widdows &amp;c. and cannot this in your opinion M. <hi>Hall</hi> be more full, more abſolute? I hope you will graunt Biſhops to be Eccleſiaſticall men, and likewiſe Prieſts, who are ordered out of wedlocke, as you were your ſelfe, if that diſorderly promotion of yours may haue that title, and then vpon that conceſſion I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8889:103"/> make this argument, or demonſtration rather to conclude you <hi>faithles:</hi> No Canon is ſo ful and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute for the marriage of Eccleſiaſticall perſons as a fuller cannot be made which allows not all Biſhops (the chiefeſt of the Clergy) &amp; all ſingle Prieſts leaue to marry, &amp; ſuch as may marry, not to take what wiues they laſt: but the Canon cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by M. <hi>Hall</hi> is ſuch a one, <hi>ergo</hi> it may be more<note place="margin">Two moſt euident demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> full and abſolute. And then further: If that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non may be more full and abſolute, then is M. <hi>Hall</hi> proued <hi>faythles</hi> with his owne conſent, but it may be more ful &amp; abſolute: for it may graunt marriage as well to Biſhops, as ſingle Prieſts, &amp; liberty to take what wiues they liſt, <hi>ergo</hi> M. <hi>Hall</hi> is <hi>faythles.</hi> I ſee not what other anſwere he can giue heereunto, then <hi>concedo totum:</hi> for it is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect forme and figure.</p>
               <p>71. And in my iudgment none can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admire the rare impudency of theſe men who vſe ſo much boaſting where they find ſo little occaſion: for whereas of foure things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in this <hi>Trullan</hi> Councell touching theſe marriages, three of them make directly for vs; he as though all ſtood full on his ſide, offers very deſperately to be condemned as <hi>faithles,</hi> if any Proteſtant Church can make a fuller decree then that which he cyteth, when as not only they can make, but <hi>de facto</hi> haue made in England, as now I will ſhew, where Biſhops and Miniſters, euen in their miniſtery marry and remarry, <hi>&amp; toti in hoc ſunt,</hi> which dealing of his, is as much as if ſome ridiculous ſouldier ſhould vantingly brag of his horſe, to be the beſt and ſwifteſt in the land, and offer to pawne his life on any race

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell touching that matter, three are flat againſt him, and the fourth alſo doth want of full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as is euident.</p>
               <p>72. For after the words cyted before by M. <hi>Hall,</hi> it followeth in the ſame Canon, <hi>Scimus &amp; qui</hi>

So in this Canon, at the making wherof it ſeemeth theſe marryed Subdeacons, Deacons, Prieſts to haue beene ordered for the want that was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſupplying the offices of the Church, and ſo were not bound alwayes, but at certayne time

               <p>73. But when it pleaſed God whoſe iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are vnſearchable to permit our countrey to make a reuolt from the knowne Catholicke Church, and to ſubmit the ſame to the maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">Iſa. 3.</note> mentioned in the Prophet: <hi>Dabopueros Prin cipes, &amp; eſſeminati dominabuntur eis.</hi> I will giue them children for their princes, and effeminate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Clergy men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King Edward the 6. far more full abſolute, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory then tha which was made in the Trullan Synod.</note> ſhall rule ouer them: then I ſay vnder a yong child, an effeminate Metropolitan, and a ſeely ſimple Protectour the fullnes of this lewd liberty did enter, and the reynes were let looſe to all licentious life: I meane in the tyme of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, when Only fayth couered all ſinnes, ſatisfyed for all villany, and ſupplyed all good workes, and when there was no mirth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Miniſters but in marriage; then I ſay in the firſt parlament (albeit King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. by the ſame authority ſome 7. years before had made it to be enacted, that Prieſts after the order of prieſthood by the law of God might not marry) it was decreed that whoſoeuer ſhould be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or were already of the Clergy, that the ſame perſon or perſons ſhould be from thence forth admitted, &amp; allowed to haue his or their<note place="margin">Anno 1.

So the Parlament.</q> And this is more full, abſolute, and peremptory, then the Canon of <hi>Trullum</hi> as you ſee: for heere that is granted, which is there denyed: there was a limitation to one wife, a prohibition from a widdow; heere hell gate it ſet wide open, and leaue giuen to the Clergy to take more wiues, or widdowes, no leſſe then for any other men, without any limitation or prohibition at all.</p>
               <p>74. But the ſtatute albeit fuller then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, yet commeth ſhort of another made in the 2. and 3. yeares of the ſame King, when at one blow they chopped off all theſe points togeather which either in the <hi>Trullan,</hi> or other Councells whatſoeuer had beene defined againſt them: for in deſpight of all the world beſides, contrary to to the whole courſe of the Chriſtian Church, Generall Councells, and continuall practiſe of all tymes and places, eſpecially of our owne country thus it was determined, and ſet downe for a law.

In that Councell Biſhops were to put their wiues far from them, heer they are permitted to keep them at home, or if they had none, to ſeeke and marry them: there the ſecond marriage, or els the taking of a widdow made men incapable of holy orders: heere no multitude of wiues or widdows do hinder at all: there to haue known a Nunne was ſacriledge, heere if ſhe liſt to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is open freedome and no prohibition: there (euen in M. <hi>Halls</hi> Canon) Subdeacons, Deacons, and Prieſts that did ſerue by courſe in the Church, where to forbeare their wiues for the tyme of their attendance: heere is no

               <p>84. After this charge (which now to his ſhame we haue diſcharged) it followeth in his <q>epiſtle. The Romaniſts in the next age (ſayth he) were ſomewhat more equall, who ſeeing themſelues preſſed with ſo flat a decree, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by authority of Emperours, as would abide no denyall, began to diſtinguiſh vpon the point, limiting this liberty only to the Eaſtern Church and graunting that all the Clergy of the Eaſt might marry, not theirs. So Pope <hi>Steuen</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</q>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:8889:109"/> freely confeſſes. The tradition, ſayth he, of<note place="margin">Anſwered by Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>cap. 21. §. ad 5. dico.</hi>
                  </note> the Eaſterne Church is otherwiſe then that of the Roman Church: for their Prieſts, Deacons, or Subdeacons are marryed, but in this Church or the Weſterne no one of the Clergy from the <q>Subdeacon to the Biſhop hath leaue to marry. So M. <hi>Hall.</hi> And then after his manner vauntingly ſayth: Liberally, but not inough: if he yield this</q> why not more? with other ſuch interrogatories as I ſhall after ſet down, when I haue refuted the former paſſage.</p>
               <p>85. Where firſt to pretermit the falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Deacons or Subdeacons, as if they were not different orders, becauſe now in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland there are no Subdeacons, and the Latin word <hi>at<expan>

Councells take not their authority from Emperours, but Emperours ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8889:110"/> Councels with their power, that all vnder them may obey what they who are in ſpiritual authority ouer them haue decreed: and M. <hi>Halls</hi> Emperours in particuler, to wit <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the yonger, <hi>Philippicus &amp;c.</hi> being ſuch as they were, we will not much enuy (<hi>M.

               <p>86. And if <hi>M.

The <hi>Monothelite</hi> heretiks will thanke you, M. <hi>Hall,</hi> and remaine your debtour. How much the Church hath gotten by Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Synods, too lamentable experience hath taught vs as well in theſe, as in diuers others, whereof one was within few yeares after this of <hi>Philippicus,</hi> called by <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Iconoclaſt,</hi> who with our Proteſtants condemned, defaced, razed, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8889:110"/> downe, abuſed and burned all ſacred images of our Sauiour, and his Saints: and (to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the later tymes as the Conuenticles of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth againſt <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeauenth &amp;c.) it is not the authority of Emperours when we ſpeake of Councells which makes them ſo firme as they can abide no denyall, but the promiſe &amp; aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt with the Paſtours of the Church, without any reference to the ciuill magiſtrate, or els the firſt Apoſtolicall Councell had beene void and of none effect, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſayd, <hi>viſum eſt Spiritui ſancto &amp;</hi>

The cauſes are different, and the Courts diuers. The ſecond vntruth is that Pope <hi>Steuen</hi> granted that the Clergy of the Eaſt might marry, which after ſhall in due place be refuted.</p>
               <p>87. The laſt vntruth is touching <hi>Steuen</hi> the ſeconds decree: for whereas in <hi>Gratian</hi> there is<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of M.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8889:111"/> falſhood of this charge doth refute it ſelfe, and demonſtratiuely ſhew this decree not to haue beene made by this <hi>Steuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>88.

               <p>89. I confeſſe that <hi>Steuen</hi> the 4. held there a Councell, but that was only called for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the falſe Pope <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and depoſing of ſuch as were ordered by him in that ſchiſme, and preuenting the like inconuenience of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a lay man to be Pope againe: for ſuch was this <hi>Conſtantine</hi> choſen by popular tumult, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all order or forme of Canonicall election,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8889:111"/> by the ſeditious and tyrannicall procurement of his brother <hi>Toto</hi> then in <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe power and violence at that tyme none could withſtand; &amp; laſt of all it diſannulled the decree of the falſe Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt holy images: but of Prieſts wiues, either in the Eaſt or Weſt, there is no mention, nor yet in any Author of theſe tymesym. When <hi>M.

               <p>90. And in caſe we graunted all the words which M. <hi>Hall</hi> bringeth out of this Canon, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Gratians Canon nothing maketh for M. Hall.</note> would follow thereof againſt vs, but that the Greeke Prieſts, Deacons, and Subdeacons were marryed, which is to be vnderſtood before their ordination, as the Gloſſe expoundeth, and the Councell as before you haue heard did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine: and it is ridiculous to ſay, as M. <hi>Hall</hi> doth, that then <hi>they began to diſtinguish:</hi> for wheras the <hi>Grecians de ſacto</hi> had in this ſeparated themſelues from the Latin Church, had made Councells, or rather Conuenticles of their owne, and were borne out in al by the ſword of their Emperors, where the fact and practiſe was ſo different, as all might ſee it with their eyes, little need there was that any ſhould inuent a diſtinction or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of liberty, as this man dreameth: and the Canon he cyteth out of <hi>Gratian</hi> (if it be a Canon) is but a declaration of the fact (which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8889:112"/> was ſo conſpicuous as could not be denyed) ſhewing only what was don in the Eaſt Church what not permitted in the Weſt.</p>
               <p>91. And wheras M. <hi>Hall</hi> auerreth, that this Canon graunted that all the Clergy of the Eaſt<note place="margin">M. Halls want of Logicke.</note> might marry, but not of the Weſt, his gloſſe fouly corrupteth the Text, and conteyneth an euident vntruth: for neither all the Clergy, nor any of the Clergy could marry in the Eaſterne Church: and this man ſeemeth to be of very groſſe capacity that will haue theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to be equipollent, or to beare the ſame ſenſe; Prieſts, Deacons, and Subdeacons in the Greeke Church are marryed, and this; all the Clergy of the Eaſt may marry: for firſt Prieſts, Deacons, and Subdeacons make not al the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or els Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Patriarches, Metropolitans ſhall not be Clergy men, which yet are the chiefeſt of that ranke, and to whome all the other as inferiours to their betters are ſubordinate and depend, which yet are debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from marriage. Againe, that Prieſts, Deacons and Subdeacons in Greece were then marryed is cleare, but it is no leſſe cleare that they were not marryed when they were Prieſts, Deacons,<note place="margin">It was lawful for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in Greece to be made Prieſts, but neuer lawful for Prieſts to marry.</note> and Subdeacons, but before, as the Councell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: for although it were permitted that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed men might be made Prieſts, yet was it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Prieſts ſhould be made marryed men, and the ſame of Deacons, and Subdeacons: and ſo I conclude with M <hi>Hall,</hi> that not only all the Clergy of Greece might not marry, but that no Clergy man in holy orders (for ſuch only are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo tearmed) might marry at all. I hope M.

                  <hi>Hall</hi> that your brayns are not ſo far ſpent, but that if you pauſe a while, and ſcratch your head where it doth not itch, you will conceaue this difference, that marryed men may be preferred to the Clergy, but not Clergy men permitted to marry: the firſt by the <hi>Trullan</hi> Councel was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the other neuer allowed: and therfore theſe words of yours, <hi>all the Clergy of the Eaſt might marry,</hi> may be crowned with a ſiluer whet-ſtone.</p>
               <p>92.

               <p>96.

If (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſignifyed) vnder the firſt and ſecond <hi>Nicholas,</hi> vnder the 9. <hi>Leo,</hi> and 7. <hi>Gregory,</hi> your owne <hi>Trullan</hi> Councell before theſe tymes is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, which forbids your Biſhops to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at all, or keep company with their wiues, &amp; would permit no Prieſt to marry. And that no Prieſt might be marryed, I haue cyted in the end of the ſecond Paragraffe many Councells out of all the coaſts of Chriſtendom. And whereas he further addeth <hi>our liberty is happily renewed with the Ghoſpell,</hi> it is hard to define what liberty, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, what Ghoſpell he meaneth; and of what God, what Church he talketh, when he ſayth: <hi>what God, what his Church hath euer allowed, we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy:</hi> for this Church is ſom inuiſible caſtle in the ayre, neuer ſeene on the earth, and this <hi>VVe,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall, and may include <hi>Lutherans, Caluiniſts, Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Puritans:</hi> &amp; let it include all or ſome one branch among all of theſe ſects, yet is the lye notorious: for in all the Chriſtian Church, this liberty hath euer beene baniſhed.</p>

               <p>22. Wherfore to end this matter with him for whome I began it, I hope now, good Syr, that you ſee M. <hi>Halls</hi> valour to haue been valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by yourſelfe at too high a rate, &amp; euen there to haue fayled where you eſteemed moſt of his ability; in this matter I meane, where beſides meere babling what hath he proued? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words hath he vſed &amp; cyted authorityes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to caſt a clowd vpon the truth, and to hide it from the eyes of his ſimple Reader? Many are his<note place="margin">M. Halls imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencyes.</note> braggs, his citations thicke, his promiſes great, his confidence ſingular, but his wit is weake, his ability ſmall, his performance nothing. After his firſt entrance with lyes which continually increaſe, he miſtaketh the ſtate of the queſtion, and talketh of many things not denyed by his aduerſary, not in controuerſy between him and vs, he bringeth in a bedrole of names of ſuch
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:8889:197"/> Biſhops as had beene marryed, but proueth not that they vſed their wiues when they were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or euer marryed againe after their wiues were dead, as <hi>Robert Abbots</hi> late of <hi>Salisbury</hi> did in great haſt with Miſtreſſe <hi>Dike.</hi> And what doth this conclude? he bringeth authorityes to proue that chaſtity is not of the ſubſtance of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not annexed by diuine law expreſly ſet downe in the Scripture, &amp; is this for him? It is againſt vs? He taxeth <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 2. and <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth for condemning of the marriages of Prieſts, who only decreed againſt their concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, without any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of their matrimony: and what can he inferre therof? In fine either he cyteth weake and counterfeit authorityes, or els miſtaketh moſt pittifully the places which he doth cite, and ſo in ſaying much, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from the Fox to the ferne buſh, from the apple to the oyſter, from the full Moone in March to the freſh flowres of May.</p>
               <p>23. On the otherſide I leaue you to ſee the authorityes I cyte either to refute his aſſertions or to confirme the contrary: the vſe of auncient tymes we muſt take from ancient writers, they as you haue ſeene, are wholy ours, they neuer allowed Biſhops to beget children, to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in that ſtate, neither do their authorityes patronize the marriage of the Clergy, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it: and in caſe ſome were marryed before their ordination, yet after they were no longer husbands, but liued apart from their wiues, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> doth witnes; &amp; I leaue you to determin whether of vs both hath <hi>further fetched, or deduced lower</hi> the cauſe he defendeth, who hath gone through more ages, places, Churches, who hath
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:8889:198"/> the generall conſent to ſtand for him? He who can ſhew the cuſtome of al the Chriſtan world, <hi>Europe, Africke,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction for the two firſt, &amp; beſt authority that can be brought for the other, or he who out of one third part culleth a ſmall parcell only, late for time, for extent not large, &amp; that not proued but by heretiks, not procured but by ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to make tumult garboyl &amp; ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Church: and then further whether without the liberty of a lye he may be ſayd to challeng the practiſe of the Chriſtian Church, or liberty of the Ghoſpell?</p>
               <p>24. Finally the ſingle life of Clergy men as in the example of the Apoſtls who left their wiues was firſt began, ſo from age to age in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church without intermiſſion hath ſtill gone on: as the practiſe thereof both for tyme, place, perſons may truely betermed Catholik or vniuerſal, which as a thing vndoubted of was ſo far forth in the 2.

               <p>25. For in K. <hi>Henryes</hi> tyme it was againſt the law of God for Prieſts to marry, in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> againſt the ſame law to forbid marriage.
